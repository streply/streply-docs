# Slack

Integration with Slack is straightforward and quick. With our integration, all alerts will be sent directly to your Slack channel.

1) The first step is to open the channel options. In the "**Integrations**" tab, under the "**App**" section, click the "**Add an app**" button.

4) To install the application, select a Slack channel to which we will send all messages. You can change this channel later.

5) Find the URL in the "**Webhook URL**" field. Copy this URL and paste it into the Streply app.

Once you've created a webhook, you can customize the app's name and logo.

6) In the Streply app, navigate to the "**Settings > Integrations**" tab and click the "**Configure**" button for Slack. This screen will display all your alerts and monitors. Paste the URL you copied from the Slack app into the "**Webhook URL**" field. Note that you can use different webhooks for each alert and monitor, corresponding to different Slack channels.
