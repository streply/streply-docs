# Check frequency

We check the monitor at regular intervals. These can be as often as every 1 minute or as rarely as every 30 minutes.

To change how often your monitor checks, follow these steps: Go to Monitors, choose a monitor, click on Configure, then Default settings. Pick an option from the dropdown menu.
