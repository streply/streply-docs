You can not only set notifications on errors (e.g. notify when a critical error occurs) but also on activities (e.g. notify when a user pays a subscription).

## Types of notifications

You can set up the notifications in two ways:

- When you enter Issues or Events, to set a notification when an event occurs that matches the search criteria you entered
- When entering the Issue data, to set a notification when the Issue occurs again
