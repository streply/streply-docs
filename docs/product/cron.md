# CRON

In the CRON tab in the Streply app, we will display all commands marked as "CRON command" divided into the selected times. It's an easy way to see which CRON jobs were executed or which jobs failed.

:::important
If you use one of our official libraries for frameworks (for example [Laravel](/php/frameworks/laravel) or [Symfony](/php/frameworks/laravel)), Streply will catch CRON commands automatically.
