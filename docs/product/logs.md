# Logs

You can use activities to measure all the important metrics in your app and business development.

The Logs module is an advanced search engine and browser of all the events that your app will send to Streply.

You will find here all types of events: 
- errors
- activities
- logs

In addition to filtering events by project and time period, you can create advanced queries based on the data sent in the events.

## Queries

You can easily return to queries that are important to you. After adding some conditions in the log query builder, it's possible to save a query.

Saved queries are displayed in the sidebar on the left side.
