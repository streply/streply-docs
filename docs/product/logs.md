# Logs

You can use activities to measure all the important metrics in your app and business development.

The Logs module is an advanced search engine and browser of all the events that your app will send to Streply.

You will find here all types of events: errors, activities and logs.

In addition to filtering events by project and time period, you can create advanced queries based on the data sent in the events.
