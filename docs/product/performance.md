# Performance

The Performance module allows analysis of the speed of both entire applications and individual parts.

With performance, you can measure the running time and behaviour of the application at its different stages.

You can place Streply client methods top-down (e.g. in the index.php file) to analyse the entire application, but you can also create a point transaction to analyse only a selected part of the program.
