# Errors number

We'll let you know if there are too many errors in a certain time period.

## How to create an alert

In the Streply app, select "Alerts" from the sidebar. 

Then, find the "Number of errors" alert and click on the "Create" button.

In the form to create an alert, you need to name the alert and choose a project. Next, select the time period and the number of errors.

That's it. We'll inform you if the number of errors in the selected period goes over the limit you set.
