Define your notifications in the app and Streply will notify you immediately when a particular situation occurs. Thanks to this, you won't miss anything important that happens in your app. You can not only set notifications on errors (e.g. notify when a critical error occurs) but also on activities (e.g. notify when a user pays a subscription)."
