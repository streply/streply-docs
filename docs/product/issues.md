# Issues

Issues are unique bugs, grouped into tasks that you and your team can work on.

![Issues](https://streply.com/images/app/issues.png)

The issues list view is all the issues that Streply has grouped into unique issues based on the errors sent.

You can filter issues by: status, application environment or the date the bug last occurred in the issue.

In this view you will also see:

- to whom the issue is assigned,
- what priority it has,
- how many times the error occurred,
- when it occurred for the first and last time,
- a chart of the occurrence of errors in the issue.

You can also quickly and conveniently change the status of an issue on this screen.

## Issue statuses

Each issue has a status, which indicates at what stage the bug is being fixed. The default status is `open`, which is when the issue is open.

Available statuses:

- `open` - New bug that nobody has addressed yet
- `done` - Bug fixed
- `ignore` - Ignore the bug (will not be shown in the list) until it occurs again
- `ignore` forever - Ignore this bug even if it occurs again

## Issue tab

The issue tab is the view that displays all error information. On this view you will find:

- the source of the code where the error occurred,
- information whether it is a new bug or a recurring one,
- information about the request,
- information about the server and the user,
- number of occurrences of the bug, number of events in the user's session, number of events of this user,
- history of bug occurrences,
- comments,
- history of status changes.

On this screen, you can also change the status, the assigned person, the priority and set a notification when a bug occurs.

You can share the URL to the bug publicly, even with a person not registered with Streply.
